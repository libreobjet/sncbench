_SNCBench is a urbanbench._

> The SNCBench is the latest in a series of free objects designed and created by the collective Libre Objet. It completes a line of street furniture that started with the uHbench a few years ago.

Commissioned by Constant to replace the old uHbench that was made during a workshop in 2015, the SNCBench follows the same principles of urban hacking: a simple form, adapted to the location, requiring little processing, made of materials generally associated with transport and whose manufacture generates little waste.

This new version of the bench, installed in front of our office at 5 Rue du Fortstraat in Saint-Gilles, is an assembly of untreated railway sleepers and threaded stainless steel rods.
